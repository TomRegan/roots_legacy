  summary: 'Product Description ''What are you thinking, Amy? The question I''ve asked
    most often during our marriage, if not out loud, if not to the person who could
    answer. I suppose these questions stormcloud over every marriage: What are you
    thinking? How are you feeling? Who are you? What have we done to each other? What
    will we do?'' Just how well can you ever know the person you love? This is the
    question that Nick Dunne must ask himself on the morning of his fifth wedding
    anniversary, when his wife Amy suddenly disappears. The police immediately suspect
    Nick. Amy''s friends reveal that she was afraid of him, that she kept secrets
    from him. He swears it isn''t true. A police examination of his computer shows
    strange searches. He says they aren''t his. And then there are the persistent
    calls on his mobile phone. So what did really did happen to Nick''s beautiful
    wife? And what was left in that half-wrapped box left so casually on their marital
    bed? In this novel, marriage truly is the art of war... About the Author Gillian
    Flynn''s first novel SHARP OBJECTS was the winner of two CWA DAGGERS, and was
